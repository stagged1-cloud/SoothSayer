# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup (2 minutes)

Your website files are ready and pushed to GitHub. Now you just need to enable GitHub Pages:

### Steps:

1. **Go to your repository:**
   - Open https://github.com/stagged1-cloud/SoothSayer

2. **Access Settings:**
   - Click the "Settings" tab (top right, next to Insights)

3. **Navigate to Pages:**
   - In the left sidebar, scroll down and click "Pages"

4. **Configure Source:**
   - Under "Build and deployment" section:
     - **Source:** Select "Deploy from a branch"
     - **Branch:** Select "main" 
     - **Folder:** Select "/docs"
   - Click "Save"

5. **Wait for Deployment:**
   - GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site
   - Takes 1-2 minutes
   - You'll see a message: "Your site is live at https://stagged1-cloud.github.io/SoothSayer/"

### Verification:

After 1-2 minutes, visit: **https://stagged1-cloud.github.io/SoothSayer/**

You should see:
- Live crypto price ticker at the top
- Hero section with "Predict Crypto Patterns with AI-Powered Analysis"
- Interactive chart visualization
- Pattern examples, features, algorithms sections
- Download buttons

## What's Included

Your website has:
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ Live crypto prices (BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB) updating every 60 seconds
- ✅ Interactive chart with pattern markers
- ✅ 9 algorithm explanations
- ✅ 70+ cryptocurrency list
- ✅ Pattern examples with real data
- ✅ Download links to APK and GitHub
- ✅ Full documentation links
- ✅ Dark theme with gradient effects
- ✅ Smooth animations and scroll effects

## Troubleshooting

**If the site doesn't load after 5 minutes:**
1. Go back to Settings → Pages
2. Check that it says "Your site is live at..."
3. Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Clear browser cache

**If you see a 404 error:**
1. Verify the branch is set to "main"
2. Verify the folder is set to "/docs"
3. Check that the files exist in the docs/ folder on GitHub

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain:
1. In GitHub Pages settings, enter your domain in "Custom domain"
2. Add DNS records at your domain provider:
   - For `www.yourdomain.com`: CNAME record pointing to `stagged1-cloud.github.io`
   - For `yourdomain.com`: A records pointing to GitHub's IPs

## Next Steps

Once the site is live:
1. Test on mobile devices
2. Share the link: https://stagged1-cloud.github.io/SoothSayer/
3. Consider adding screenshots of the app to the hero section
4. Plan for Option B (full web app) if you want real-time pattern detection in browser
