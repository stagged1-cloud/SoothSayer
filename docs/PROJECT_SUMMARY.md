# SoothSayer Project Summary

## Technology Decisions & Rationale

### Language: **Kotlin**  CHOSEN

**Why Kotlin over Java:**

. **Speed**: 
   - Null safety eliminates NullPointerException crashes (40% fewer bugs)
   - Coroutines are -x more efficient than Java threads
   - Inline functions reduce method call overhead
   - Data classes eliminate boilerplate (faster development)

. **Reliability**:
   - Official Android language (Google backing since 07)
   - 95% of top 000 Android apps use Kotlin
   - Better type inference = fewer runtime errors
   - Immutable by default = safer concurrency

. **Functionality**:
   - Extension functions for cleaner code
   - Higher-order functions enable functional programming
   - Sealed classes for exhaustive when statements
   - Operator overloading for mathematical calculations

4. **Support**:
   - First-class Android Studio support
   - Jetpack libraries Kotlin-first
   - Huge community (6M+ developers)
   - Better documentation than Java

**Performance Comparison:**
```
Operation          Kotlin    Java
Null checks        0ms       5-0ms (try-catch)
List operations    Fast      Slow (verbose)
Coroutines         Async     Callback hell
Lambda functions   Native    Verbose
```

### Data Sources Strategy

#### Primary: **Binance** 

**Advantages:**
-  FREE - No API key required for public endpoints
-  FAST - Sub-00ms response times
-  RELIABLE - 99.9% uptime
-  COMPREHENSIVE - 000 records per request
-  HIGH LIMITS - 00 requests/minute
-  ACCURATE - Industry-leading data quality

**Why Primary:**
- Most reliable crypto exchange by volume
- Real-time data with minimal lag
- Historical data back to 07
- No rate limiting issues for our use case

#### Fallback: **CoinGecko** 

**Advantages:**
-  FREE - No API key for basic tier
-  BROAD COVERAGE - ,000+ cryptocurrencies
-  AGGREGATED DATA - Multiple exchange sources
-  GOOD DOCUMENTATION

**Why Fallback:**
- Slower response times (00-500ms)
- Lower rate limits (0-50 calls/min free tier)
- Good backup when Binance unavailable

#### Backup: **CryptoCompare** 

**Advantages:**
-  FREE TIER - 00,000 calls/month
-  HISTORICAL DATA - Extensive archives
-  ALTERNATIVE SOURCE - Different data perspective

**Why Backup:**
- Requires API key (extra setup)
- Lower priority but good tertiary option

### Storage Strategy: **Hybrid Approach** 

#### Local Storage (Android - Room Database)

**What We Store Locally:**
-  Last 90 days of daily OHLCV data
-  All detected patterns (small footprint)
-  User preferences and favorites

**Database Size Estimates:**

| Data Type | Records | Size per Record | Total Size |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|------------|
| PriceData (0 cryptos, 90 days) | 900 | 40 bytes | 6 KB |
| Patterns (avg 5 per crypto) | 50 | 00 bytes | 5 KB |
| CryptoAssets | 0 | 50 bytes | 0.5 KB |
| **TOTAL** | | | **~4 KB** |

**Benefits:**
-  Instant offline access
-  Minimal app size impact (<50KB)
-  Battery efficient (no constant API calls)
-  Works without internet

**Optimization Techniques:**
. **Auto-cleanup**: Delete data older than 90 days
. **Compression**: Store only essential fields
. **Indexing**: Fast queries on timestamp and symbol
4. **Batch inserts**: Reduce write operations

#### Cloud Storage (Optional - Future Enhancement)

**What Could Be Cloud-Based:**
- Full historical data (5+ years)
- Backup of user settings
- Advanced pattern predictions
- Multi-device sync

**Recommended Services:**
- Firebase Firestore (free tier: GB storage)
- AWS S (pay-as-you-go)
- Google Cloud Storage

**Current Decision: LOCAL ONLY** 
- Keeps app lightweight
- No cloud dependencies
- Better privacy
- Can add later if needed

## Pattern Detection Algorithms (ALL 8+)

###  Implemented Pattern Types:

. **Time-Based Patterns**
   - Hourly patterns (specific hours show trends)
   - Daily patterns (day of week analysis)
   - Weekly patterns (week number patterns)
   - Monthly patterns (seasonal monthly trends)
   - Yearly/Quarterly patterns

. **Moving Averages**
   - 7-day / 0-day MA crossovers
   - Golden cross / Death cross detection
   - MA trend following

. **Volume Correlation**
   - High volume spike detection
   - Price-volume relationship analysis
   - Unusual trading activity alerts

4. **Volatility Analysis**
   - High volatility period detection
   - Low volatility consolidation
   - Breakout prediction from low-vol periods

5. **Support/Resistance Levels**
   - Recurring price level detection
   - Support bounce identification
   - Resistance rejection patterns

6. **Seasonal Trends**
   - Quarterly performance patterns
   - Month-over-month comparisons
   - Cyclical trend detection

7. **Consecutive Patterns**
   - Winning streak detection (+ days up)
   - Losing streak detection (+ days down)
   - Streak reversal predictions

8. **Price Movement Patterns**
   - Significant spike detection (>x average)
   - Major drop identification
   - Consolidation period recognition

### Pattern Confidence Scoring

Each pattern receives a **confidence score (0.0 - .0)** based on:
- Frequency of occurrence
- Consistency (low standard deviation)
- Recency of last occurrence
- Statistical significance

**Minimum Thresholds (Configurable):**
- Confidence: 60% (0.6)
- Frequency:  occurrences minimum

## Architecture: Clean Architecture + MVVM

```

      UI Layer (Fragments/Activities)     
              ViewModels                  

                 

         Domain Layer (Use Cases)         
     DetectPatternsUseCase               
     LoadCryptoAssetsUseCase             

                 

         Data Layer                       
        
   Repository      API Clients      
   (Multi-src)     (Binance etc)    
        
        
   Room DB         PatternAnalyz    
   (Local)         (Algorithm)      
        

```

**Why This Architecture:**
-  **Testable**: Each layer can be tested independently
-  **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns
-  **Scalable**: Easy to add new features
-  **Reliable**: Type-safe dependencies with Hilt
