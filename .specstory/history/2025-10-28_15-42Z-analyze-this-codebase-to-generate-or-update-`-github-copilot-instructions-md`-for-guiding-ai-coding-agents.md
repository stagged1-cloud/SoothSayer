Analyze this codebase to generate or update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for guiding AI coding agents.

Focus on discovering the essential knowledge that would help an AI agents be immediately productive in this codebase. Consider aspects like:
- The "big picture" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand - major components, service boundaries, data flows, and the "why" behind structural decisions
- Critical developer workflows (builds, tests, debugging) especially commands that aren't obvious from file inspection alone
- Project-specific conventions and patterns that differ from common practices
- Integration points, external dependencies, and cross-component communication patterns

Source existing AI conventions from `**/{.github/copilot-instructions.md,AGENT.md,AGENTS.md,CLAUDE.md,.cursorrules,.windsurfrules,.clinerules,.cursor/rules/**,.windsurf/rules/**,.clinerules/**,README.md}` (do one glob search).

Guidelines (read more at https://aka.ms/vscode-instructions-docs):
- If `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists, merge intelligently - preserve valuable content while updating outdated sections
- Write concise, actionable instructions (~0-50 lines) using markdown structure
- Include specific examples from the codebase when describing patterns
- Avoid generic advice ("write tests", "handle errors") - focus on THIS project's specific approaches
- Document only discoverable patterns, not aspirational practices
- Reference key files/directories that exemplify important patterns

Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for the user, then ask for feedback on any unclear or incomplete sections to iterate.

I'll analyze this codebase to generate comprehensive `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file. Let me start by exploring the workspace structure and existing documentation. Let me explore the .specstory directory and search for more files:
