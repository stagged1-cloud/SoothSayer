## [Unreleased]

### Added (October 29, 2025)

#### Pattern Markers on Charts
- Visual pattern detection markers (colored dots) on price charts
- Pattern markers now appear on both main chart and fullscreen chart
- Color-coded markers by pattern type:
  - Red: Bearish patterns (RSI Oversold, Price Drop, Resistance, Consecutive Losses)
  - Green: Bullish patterns (RSI Overbought, MA Cross, Breakout, Consecutive Gains)
  - Yellow/Gold: Support Levels
  - Blue: Divergence patterns (Bullish/Bearish)
  - Orange: Volume Spikes
  - Purple: Volatility patterns (High/Low)
- Interactive pattern tooltips showing pattern type and confidence percentage on tap
- Descriptive legend labels (Bearish Signals, Bullish Signals, etc.) instead of generic "Patterns"
- Legend automatically hides when no patterns detected
- Larger marker dots (8px) in fullscreen for better visibility

#### RSI Technical Indicator
- RSI (Relative Strength Index) pattern detection algorithm
- Four RSI-based pattern types:
  - RSI Oversold (below 30) - selling pressure exhausted, potential bounce
  - RSI Overbought (above 70) - buying pressure exhausted, potential pullback
  - RSI Bullish Divergence - price lower lows, RSI higher lows (reversal signal)
  - RSI Bearish Divergence - price higher highs, RSI lower highs (reversal signal)
- RSI confidence scoring (0.6-0.95) based on extremity
- Pattern enhancement system: RSI confirms other patterns for 8-15% confidence boost
- Multi-indicator confirmation increases accuracy (RSI + MA = 73%, RSI + MA + Support = 92%)

#### GitHub Pages Website
- Complete landing page at https://stagged1-cloud.github.io/SoothSayer/
- Live cryptocurrency price ticker (BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB)
- Interactive hero chart with pattern marker demonstration
- Feature showcase grid (9 detection algorithms, 70+ cryptos, real-time analysis)
- Pattern examples section with confidence scores
- Algorithm cards explaining all 9 detection methods
- Mobile responsive design

#### "How It Works" Educational Section
- Statistical pattern recognition explanation
- 4-step process visualization with connected card design:
  1. Data Collection (90 days OHLCV from Binance API)
  2. Multi-Algorithm Analysis (9 parallel algorithms)
  3. Pattern Validation (statistical thresholds)
  4. Confidence Scoring (historical accuracy + multi-indicator confirmation)
- Detailed algorithm explanations for 6 key methods:
  - RSI with formula, how/why it works, real examples
  - Moving Average Crossovers (Golden Cross/Death Cross)
  - Support & Resistance Levels (bounce probability)
  - Volume Correlation (smart money tracking)
  - Bullish/Bearish Divergences (hidden strength/weakness)
- Real accuracy data (65-92% success rates with confirmations)

#### "How to Use" Trading Guide
- 6-card comprehensive guide for traders:
  1. Understanding Confidence Scores (60-69% weak, 70-79% moderate, 80-89% strong, 90-100% very strong)
  2. Multi-Indicator Confirmation strategies (wait for 2-3 indicators to align)
  3. Risk Management (position sizing, stop losses, take profits, diversification)
  4. Reading Pattern Details (frequency, last occurrence, average return, predicted next)
  5. What to Look For (ideal trading setups, high-probability patterns)
  6. Common Mistakes to Avoid (overtrading, ignoring stops, revenge trading)
- Real-world BTC trading example with full setup breakdown
- Entry/exit strategy with risk/reward calculation
- Triple confirmation example showing 91% success probability
